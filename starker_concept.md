# Starker Technical Documentation

## System Overview

Starker is a Docker orchestration platform that treats every application deployment as a Docker Compose configuration. The system manages the complete lifecycle of containerized applications through intelligent resource management and database-driven state tracking.

## Core Architecture

### Design Philosophy

Starker operates on the principle that all applications should be deployed as Docker Compose configurations containing multiple containers. This standardized approach enables consistent management, predictable resource utilization, and streamlined operational workflows.

### Primary Components

**Orchestration Engine**: The central component responsible for parsing Docker Compose files, managing deployment lifecycles, and coordinating resource operations across the entire system.

**Database Layer**: A persistent storage system that maintains real-time state information for all Docker resources including containers, networks, and volumes across all deployments.

**Resource Manager**: Handles the intelligent allocation, reuse, and cleanup of Docker resources with particular emphasis on volume optimization and network management.

**State Synchronization Service**: Ensures consistency between the actual Docker daemon state and the database records through continuous monitoring and reconciliation.

## Deployment Workflow

### Pre-Deployment Phase

When a new deployment is initiated, Starker begins by parsing the Docker Compose configuration to understand the required resources. The system then queries the database to retrieve the current state of all existing resources associated with the project.

### Cleanup Operations

Starker performs comprehensive cleanup before deploying new resources. All containers from previous deployments are stopped and removed to prevent conflicts. Networks that are no longer needed are deleted to free up network space and prevent naming collisions.

### Volume Management Strategy

The volume management system implements sophisticated comparison logic. When encountering volumes in the new configuration, Starker compares them against existing volumes in the database. If a volume configuration is identical to an existing one, the system reuses the existing volume to preserve data and improve deployment speed.

When volume configurations differ from existing ones, Starker creates new volumes. The system provides an optional purge mechanism where users can explicitly request deletion of old volumes that are no longer needed.

### Deployment Execution

After cleanup completion, Starker executes the Docker Compose deployment with the optimized resource mappings. The system monitors the deployment process and captures all new container, network, and volume identifiers.

### Post-Deployment Synchronization

Following successful deployment, Starker performs a complete state synchronization between the Docker daemon and the database. This ensures that all running containers, active networks, and mounted volumes are accurately recorded with their current status and configuration.

## Resource Management

### Container Lifecycle

Containers are managed as ephemeral resources that can be created and destroyed without data loss. Each deployment cycle removes all previous containers and creates fresh instances with updated configurations. Container metadata including image versions, environment variables, and runtime configuration is stored in the database for tracking and auditing purposes.

### Network Administration

Networks are treated as project-scoped resources that are recreated with each deployment. This approach ensures clean network isolation and prevents configuration drift between deployments. Custom network configurations defined in the Docker Compose file are preserved and reapplied during each deployment cycle.

### Volume Persistence Strategy

Volumes receive special treatment due to their data-bearing nature. The system implements a content-aware comparison mechanism that analyzes volume mount points, driver configurations, and other metadata to determine compatibility between existing and required volumes.

When volumes are determined to be compatible, they are preserved across deployments to maintain data continuity. When incompatible, new volumes are created and users are given the option to purge old volumes either immediately or during a maintenance window.

## State Management

### Database Consistency

The database serves as the authoritative source of truth for all resource states. Before each operation, Starker queries the database to understand the current environment state. After each operation, the database is updated to reflect the new state, ensuring consistency across the entire system.

### Reconciliation Process

Starker implements a reconciliation mechanism that periodically compares the database state with the actual Docker daemon state. Any discrepancies are logged and can trigger automated corrective actions or manual intervention depending on configuration.

### Audit Trail

All resource changes are logged with timestamps, user information, and configuration details. This audit trail enables troubleshooting, compliance reporting, and deployment rollback capabilities.

## Performance Optimization

### Resource Reuse

The system prioritizes resource reuse wherever possible. Volume reuse eliminates data migration overhead and reduces deployment time. Network reuse patterns are analyzed to optimize network creation and deletion cycles.

### Parallel Operations

Where safe, Starker performs operations in parallel. Container cleanup, network deletion, and volume analysis can occur simultaneously to reduce overall deployment time.

### Caching Strategy

Frequently accessed database queries are cached to reduce lookup overhead during high-frequency deployment scenarios. Docker image pulling is optimized through intelligent layer caching and registry coordination.

## Operational Considerations

### Scaling Behavior

Starker scales linearly with the number of compose projects and containers. The database design supports horizontal scaling for high-volume deployment scenarios. Resource cleanup operations are designed to be non-blocking and can be tuned based on system capacity.

### Monitoring Integration

The system provides hooks for external monitoring systems to track deployment success rates, resource utilization trends, and performance metrics. Health check data from containers is aggregated and made available for alerting and dashboard systems.

### Backup and Recovery

Database backups should include all state tables to enable complete system recovery. Volume backup strategies should be implemented independently based on application requirements and data criticality.

## Error Handling

### Deployment Failures

When deployments fail, Starker maintains the previous successful state in the database while logging failure details. Automatic rollback capabilities can restore the last known good configuration if enabled.

### Resource Conflicts

The system detects and resolves common resource conflicts such as port binding collisions, volume mount conflicts, and network naming issues through intelligent retry mechanisms and alternative resource allocation.

### Data Integrity

Database transactions ensure that partial state updates cannot corrupt the system state. All resource operations are wrapped in appropriate transaction boundaries to maintain consistency even during system interruptions.
